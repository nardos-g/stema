                This are just card views arranged vertically
                and are the main areas to show news
                and current posts.

                Below I will list out the main properties
                that should be exibhited in this card
                views.

            <h3>Markos Amsalu</h3>
            <p>
                They should have variable length
                They should have smooth edges in the 
                corner.
            </p>

            <h3>Haileyesuse Shimelash</h3>
            <p>
                If it could have some material design
                feel, it would be very attractive.
    
                I think the kind of edges that they 
                should have, the shadows must be clearly 
                investigated as part of the UI design
                procedure.

            This is a left side bar which is to show
            online people. And it should be very
            attractive.

            How can I bring it up and make it work
            flawlessly.
